// We have number of chess players and some finished matches,
// you should write a function and find out which players should play together

// The matches should be returned in an sorted array, with each match stored as [m-i, m-j], where m-i < m-j

// Example
// For chessPlayers = 4 and finishedMatches = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]]
// the output should be
// solution(chessPlayers, finishedMatches) = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3]]

const solution = (chessPlayers, finishedMatches) => {
  // your code
};
